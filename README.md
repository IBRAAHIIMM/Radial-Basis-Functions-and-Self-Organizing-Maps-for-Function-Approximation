# Radial-Basis-Functions-and-Self-Organizing-Maps-for-Function-Approximation
In MATLAB, Radial Basis Function Network is implemented in order to approximate a function. 
SOM is implemented in order to approximate a function as well and in order to organize the neurons according to given circle data.
